define this sets of data with codes.  The Automated Decentralized Education (AdecenTED) Ecosystem platform will be an innovative approach part to interactive learning, leveraging blockchain technology to enhance academic processes unbundling centralised administrative database in capturing grades manually, to now automate classroom rewards and project participation in tertiary institutions. It should integrates blockchain decentralized  (dApp) with smart contracts to record academic progress through cryptographic node of individual digital identity ledgers. The platform should incentivize academic activities with token, as well as capture their works as NFT's, providing token rewards for classwork, projects, tutorials, and more activities. 
The  incorporation of a virtual environment classroom within the Metaverse is prosposed, where avatars recognises and reward achievements and participation using tokens and digital badges. 
The platform is set to use University of Ilorin as prototype interface,Using department of Educational Technology courses. the instructor interface should feature names as Prof M.O. Yusuf, Prof. S.A Onasanya Prof. C.O. Olumonrin, Prof. Obielodan, Prof. Ogunlade, Prof. Soetan, Prof.Nafisat Shittu
Additionally, the student interface should bear names; like Bulus Steven Michael, Emmanuel Ozoveze, Akeem Ibrahim, Alafara Yusuf, Immam Khalid, Bitrus Ishaya, Aisha Mahmud, Oluwayomi Olawale, Abimbola Rebecca, Habiba Muhammad, Adeleye Adewumi,Keziah Michael, Tabitha Bulus.The planned platform carry the tag for platform creator as Bulus Steven Michael Project. The AdecenTED system should have an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain capacity, for the sake of  its low gas fees to provide a cost-efficient experience for users. 
The other aspect should be Award of credentials as NFT's
Key features of the platform include the implementation of ERC-721,20,1155 tokens to manage unique digital assets effectively with the integration of InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized storage of metadata and digital assets. This will ensures that enhanced security, accessibility, and scalability is maintained. 
Development of AdecenTED platform is meant for a Master thesis Project themed: Centralised Education to Decentralisation and Harnessing Blockchain and the Metaverse through Web3 Technologies in Universities in Kwara State. please  ensure smooth functionality and user experience. By incorporating cutting-edge blockchain solutions, AdecenTED aims to revolutionize education, making it more decentralized, transparent, and rewarding with distruptive technologies to Unbundling centralised educational Servers, used for day in day out University Administration.
